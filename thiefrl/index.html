<h2>ThiefRL</h2>
<p>The Thief-like Rogue-like</p>

<p class="poem">Through the streets and courtyards creeping<br>
While the populace is sleeping<br>
Guards patrol to keep you out<br>
If they see you they will shout<br>
Douse the torch and pick the lock<br>
Pilfer every building's stock<br>
When the dawn arrives you'll be<br>
Safely sailing o'er the sea.</p>

<p>I made this some time in the 2008 time frame, judging by the dates on the blog posts. It's got a lot more
features in it than the later version I did for a 7DRL: lock-picking, notes and signs to read, lights and light
switches, and a neutral sea captain of the ship you're berthed on. He's there to give you a safe place to
practice the stealth mechanics, and a way to end the game once you've collected all the loot.</p>
<p>The map is fixed, although it is randomly mirrored and the locks are all randomized. There are some goofy
little things in it; I was just trying a lot of things out. You might see a ghost wandering around out of
the corner of your eye; it doesn't do anything.</p>
